                >Sentiment Analysis</a
              >
              <p>
                Developed a model that determines the positivity or negativity
                of any given review, whether it's about a product, a movie, or
                food, etc. This included training the model in Python using a
                dataset and incorporating various antonyms, synonyms, and
                punctuation marks to enhance its accuracy. To achieve this,
                Negation Handling was used to pay particular attention to
                analyzing negative reviews with positive phrases. To make the
                model more interactive, a feature was integrated which allows
                users input their own reviews and obtain an immediate sentiment.
                To acheive this, Streamlit, an open-source platform, was used to
                create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input
                reviews and interact with the responses (positive or negative).

              <p>
                Developed a Predictive Modeling project for Diabetes Patient
                Readmissions using Python and scikit-learn. The project involved
                collecting and preprocessing a dataset of 101,766 records,
                addressing missing values, and performing feature engineering.
                Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key predictors
                of readmissions, such as number of diagnoses, hospital stays,
                and medications. Implemented and compared machine learning
                models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to
                predict 30-day readmissions. Evaluated model performance using
                metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, with
                the Random Forest model achieving the highest performance.

                >Trimet Route Insight Project</a
              >
              <p>
                Developed a real-time data pipeline to ingest and process
                TriMet's GPS and stop events data, overcoming challenges using
                Kafka and Postgres. Implemented a Kafka Producer and Consumer
                for publishing and consuming data in real-time, with the
                Consumer inserting data into Postgres seamlessly. The project
                resulted in significant improvements in system performance and
                reliability, addressing latency, data loading, and
                transformation challenges. Acquired hands-on experience in
                building end-to-end data streaming pipelines, conducting
                analytics with Pandas, and implementing Producer and Consumer
                models using Python. Additionally, successfully loaded data into
                Postgres using SQL.

                Developed a Database Management System (DBMS) project focused on
                music data analysis using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin. The project
                encompassed collecting diverse music-related datasets,
                performing data preprocessing and cleaning, crafting SQL queries
                for in-depth data analysis, and employing Python for data
                visualization and query plan analysis.
